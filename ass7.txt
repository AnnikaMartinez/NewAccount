Power source. A server room typically consumes significant power. A server room must have a continuous power source. Consider having a backup power so that it will keep servers running and have time to switch power sources or for enough time to make a safe shutdown. 
Climate. A room needs to be maintained to control humidity and air temperature. To prevent the equipment from overheating or causing fire, it requires constant cooling. 
Fire control system. Chemical-based fire suppression systems are required to be used in server rooms since it will not damage the equipment unlike the water sprinkles that could damage the equipment. The chemical, such as Halon extinguishes fires by reducing the oxygen level in the room below 16 percent, which cannot sustain combustion. CO2 fire extinguishers are another option for use on electrical fires involving sensitive, high-value electrical equipment. It leaves no residue, is non-conductive, and is a non-contaminating gas. The CO2 essentially suffocates the fire, removing oxygen from the area and thus disrupting and extinguishing it. This type of extinguisher is certainly safe for your electronic equipment.
Maintaining physical security. For a server roomâ€™s physical security, it is required to be constantly maintained.  Server rooms are usually kept locked with access allowed to certain individuals only. Speaking of the access control, some of these are ID cards, badges, locks and keys, fingerprint detection, alarms and alarm systems and security cameras.
